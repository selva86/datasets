The think tank of China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force recently recruited 13 Chinese technicians
 from private companies, PLA Daily reported on Saturday.
Zhang Hao and 12 other science and technology experts received letters of appointment at the founding ceremony of
the PLA Rocket Force national defense science and technology experts panel, according to a report published by the
PLA Daily on Saturday.
Honored as “rocket force science and technology experts,” Zhang and his fellow experts from private companies will
serve as members of the PLA Rocket Force think tank, which will conduct research into fields like overall design of
the missiles, missile launching and network system technology for five years.
The experts will enjoy the same treatment as their counterparts from State-owned firms, the report said.
The PLA Daily said that this marks a new development in deepening military-civilian integration in China, which
could make science and technology innovation better contribute to the enhancement of the force’s combat capabilities.
